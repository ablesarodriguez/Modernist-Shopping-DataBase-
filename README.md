# Modernist-Shopping-DataBase-
## Course Description

In this course, we learned how databases work, focusing on relational models, SQL, and database design. The goal was to understand how to structure and manage large amounts of data efficiently while ensuring consistency and security.

## Practical Work

For the practical part, we worked in teams to design and implement a database from scratch. It started with gathering requirements from a simulated client, then designing an entity-relationship diagram, and finally translating it into a working relational model. We created SQL scripts to set up the database and populate it with data. 

The final part of the project involved executing complex queries to ensure the database functioned correctly and writing a report explaining our design choices.
